# Pytorch on pure Numpy 

## Description
This project is a Pytorch library implementation, using exclusively Numpy. It includes modules, layers, AutoGrad implementation, and more.

Also, the project may be useful for those involved in Pitch optimization, as it can help them identify where bottlenecks may be.

In general, the project will be useful for those who want to understand how Pytorch works under the hood.
